/**
 * Explanation:
 *
 * The program takes input from the user using the Scanner class and stores it in the variable num.
 * Then, it uses a while loop to continuously extract the last digit of the num using the modulo operator
 * (%) and add it to a new variable reverse multiplied by 10.
 * After each iteration, the num is divided by 10 to remove the last digit.
 * The loop continues until num becomes 0.
 * Finally, the reversed number is printed to the console.
